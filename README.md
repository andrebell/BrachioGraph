# BrachioGraph-plotter

This repositories contains all files, which we developed during our maker days these easter holidays. I started this project to try the BrachoGraph project from [Make Magazin](http://make-magazin.de/x6n4) to have some fun and moreover to learn how to use the Raspberry Pi and write code in Python. Therefore, this repository not only contains the original files from the article of the make magazine, but all our additional files, that evolved during the learning process.

## Experiment 01

To illustrate the basic concepts of GPIOs and python programs controlling the GPIOs, we have set up two LEDs on the GPIO ports 4 and 17. This program is just a simple blinking light on both LEDs.
