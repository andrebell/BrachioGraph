# BrachioGraph-plotter

This repositories contains all files, which we developed during our maker days these easter holidays. I started this project to try the BrachoGraph project from [Make Magazin](http://make-magazin.de/x6n4) to have some fun and moreover to learn how to use the Raspberry Pi and write code in Python. Therefore, this repository not only contains the original files from the article of the make magazine, but all our additional files, that evolved during the learning process.

## 01 - GPIO Experiment

To illustrate the basic concepts of GPIOs and python programs controlling the GPIOs, we have set up two LEDs on the GPIO ports 4 and 17. This program is just a simple blinking light on both LEDs.

## 02 - PWM servo experiment

A servo requires a pulse-width-modulated signal (PWM) to control its position. The jupyter notebook is to illustrate, what a PWM signal actually looks like. You can try it out on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andrebell/brachiograph.git/master?filepath=%2F02_pwm_servo_experiment%2Fpwm_demo.ipynb). Please execute each cell with `Shift`+`Return`.

## 03 - Construction

As a third step we follow along the descriptions given here
